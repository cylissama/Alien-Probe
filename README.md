## Project Overview

This is a group project for our senior project course, CS496, where we develop a system, app, or program for a client from our campus. Our client is from WKU's Parking and Transportation department, and our project aims to enhance the parking experience and ease of use for the employees on campus through technology.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create an RFID tag recognition system using the Alien ALR F800 RFID reader and an Alien Scanner Antenna. This system will allow for easier identification of cars in the campus parking lots, streamlining the parking process and improving overall parking management.

## Structure

The Alien PROBE Java GUI is just a simple app we created using JFrame for early testing. You can use a reader's IP and Port just like the Android app. Data can be saved locally into a file.

Android App contains the Alien PROBE android application that this project focuses on. This app features all the main functionality mentioned within our documentation. Scan, Save, and Upload RFID tag read data.
