## Project Overview

This is a group project for our senior project course, CS496, where we develop a system, app, or program for a client from our campus. Our client is from WKU's Parking and Transportation department, and our project aims to enhance the parking experience and ease of use for the employees on campus through technology.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a RFID tag recognition system using the Alien ALR F800 RFID reader and an Alien Scanner Antenna. This system will allow for easier identification of cars in the campus' parking lots, streamlining the parking process and improving overall parking management.
