Note:
In comments throughout the code, we use a few tags to signify where more work can be done. You can search these tags with Ctrl+F.
"$$" signifies that there is something that we can/should improve.
"$?" or "$$?" signifies that there may be something that we can improve.
"$$$" (or more dollar signs) is usually placed near commented out code or lines added for debugging. Should be removed in the final version.
